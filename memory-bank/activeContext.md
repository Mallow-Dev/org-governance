# Active Context

## Current Focus: Phase 4 Acceleration

We are aggressively rolling out the "Intelligence Layer" of governance within 2 months.

## Recent Accomplishments

- **Documentation**: Updated `git-branching-strategy` (Tiered Reviews) and `mcp/README` (Python Stack).
- **Prototyping**: Created `mcp-server` skeleton (Python/FastAPI) with `setup.sh` for venv enforcement.
- **Design**: Established "Premium" Dashboard design (Glassmorphism).
- **Automation**: Created `sync-branch-protection.ts` script (enhanced with dry-run and overrides).
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Applied branch protection to all repos, deployed MCP server.
- **Conversation Journaling**: Created workflow, automation script, and format standard.
