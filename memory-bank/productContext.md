# Product Context

## The Problem

- **Scattered Standards**: Documentation exists in multiple places or not at all.
- **Settings Drift**: GitHub repo settings diverge over time without audit trails.
- **Agent Blindness**: AI agents lack context on "how we do things here," leading to non-compliant code generation.
- **Onboarding Friction**: New developers (and agents) struggle to find the "right" way to contribute.

## The Solution

A centralized **Governance Repository** that serves as the brain of the organization.

- **For Humans**: A clear reference for workflows (Git, PRs) and standards.
- **For Agents**: An MCP server that provides semantic access to policies, enabling self-correction.
- **For Leadership**: A dashboard showing real-time compliance and health.

## User Experience Goals

- **"It just works"**: Agents automatically know the rules.
- **"Premium" Feel**: The dashboard and docs should feel high-quality and authoritative.
- **Low Friction**: Governance should speed up development (via clarity), not slow it down (via bureaucracy).
