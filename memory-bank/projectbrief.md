# Project Brief: Organisational Governance

## Core Mission

Establish a **Single Source of Truth** for all Mallow-Dev standards, workflows, and policies, accessible to both humans and AI agents via MCP.

## Key Objectives

1. **Centralise Knowledge**: Eliminate scattered documentation.
2. **Enable AI Agents**: Provide structured context via MCP (Model Context Protocol).
3. **Enforce Standards**: Automate compliance (branch protection, commit formats).
4. **Accelerate Onboarding**: Clear, discoverable guidelines for new devs.

## Core Components

- **Governance Repo**: Markdown-based policies and standards.
- **MCP Server**: Python-based server exposing docs to agents.
- **Dashboard**: "Premium" UI for visualizing compliance.
- **Automation**: Scripts to sync settings and validate PRs.
